# FCC-Personal-Portfolio-Page
This is my final challenge in the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design Cerification. It's a personal portfolio page using CSS Flexbox and a little CSS animation.

I used http://www.color-hex.com to choose colors.

I added a box-shadow based on an example from [W3Schools in their CSS Shadows section](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows.asp).

Using flexbox means this is completely mobile friendly.
